# About the Community

Meduware community is actively engaged in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and has grown over time to become one of the most respected communities. We were active from February 24, 2019, to May 17, 2022, and during this period, we became a successful community, reaching thousands of members and followers. We express our gratitude to our community members for their generous contributions and support.

# About the Website

This website has been developed as part of the Meduware community and was personally created by me. I am sharing the source files of this project here, as I want it to maintain its presence on the internet. This project holds a special place for me, as it is the first project where I started coding websites. It serves as a personal indicator of my development. I am here to share with you, show where I have come in my learning journey, and inspire my future projects. Your contributions and feedback are always welcomed.
